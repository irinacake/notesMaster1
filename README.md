# Public notes sharing

The goal of this repository is to act as a tool to share the content of the notes I take from the different classes and "TDs" I attend.

These notes are taken with LaTeX and published on the repository as exported PDF files. Only the PDF files are shared here.

### Disclaimers

Please be advised that :

- These files **DO NOT** replace actual classes. Please do not skip them (especially "TDs") ;

- You should assume that these files **HAVE NOT** been proofread by teachers (some may have been), as such, they **could** contain mistakes (or other sorts of typos) ;

- I **CANNOT** be held responsible if you happen to be mislead by the content of these files ;

- The content of these files may not match what you have done during your class if the teacher was a different one ;

- While I intend to update this repository on a weekly basis, do not expect it to be updated on a strict schedule ;

- As of the creating of this repository, my LaTeX skills are not great, so do not expect perfect formatting (I am trying my best)
